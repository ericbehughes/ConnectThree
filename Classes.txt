1. server software will display its IP address?
	shouldnt that be client displaying from server data

2. user input the IP address of the server?
	to change the server IP address or choose its location? will it be like a pass or fail message?

3. figure out what quitting means? closing connection, saving data 

4. game logic 
	should everything be on the backend and client just sends moves. or is there game logic validation on the client before the move is sent to the server.
